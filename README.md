# Shiny-App-for-class


I had to build an app for a class. We were using MIT App Developer to build our apps, and I asked if I could build an app using Shiny. The teacher agreed. 

This is a basic visualization App. That allow's one to visualize and explore pitcher statistics. 

Here is the link to the app: https://julien1993.shinyapps.io/Shiny-App-5/
